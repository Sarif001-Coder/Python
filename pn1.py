#In this first file lets talk about variable n data types in python.

#to print anything:
print("hello") 
op=hello

print(23)
op=23


#to know the type of any statement.
 #let say 
 s='strings'
 
 print(type(s))
 op=str or string
 
 #single or multiple char. both will return str in type.


#Basic types are
-str = strings
-int = integers
-float = decimals
-bool = true/false

#with this speacialcharacter starting given to any line is considered to be Comment
#there is no concept of multiline comment here.

#practice
print('12a') => 12a str
print('10') => 10 str
print(11.90) => float
print(False) => bool
